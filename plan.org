#+title: Functionality to be built

* Finish off generic base class

** Finish GAT for single class classification

*** DONE Debug back propagation

*** DONE Test out performance on single task classification problems

    - single task performance from most models seems similar and very suspicious

** Add in extra features to GAT 

*** TODO Inspect final layer - reference GAT implementation outputs raw scores

*** TODO Skip connections

*** TODO Dropout (feature and attention seperately)

*** TODO Batch norm?

** TODO Different readout modes ( that is aggregating info from nodes into a single graph classification)

   - at the moment, just averaging across modes
   - allow for different options

** Add in skip connections to all models ( maybe in the generic class ) 

** Build out multitask classification

*** TODO Try add it into generic model

**** TODO Examine how the batching is affected ( specifically the final line/part of forward )

**** TODO Inspect how it affects dataset class

**** TODO Check out loss function changes

*** TODO Flex out the data handling tools

**** TODO e.g. check out the DGL batch graph functions

** Finish off GIN (check out DGL Life Sci)

** Add in jumping knowledge [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03536][Representation Learning on Graphs with Jumping Knowledge Networks]]
