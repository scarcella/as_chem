#+TITLE: Common PyTorch errors (& fixes hopefully)


* Only Tensors of floating point and complex dtype can require gradients

- https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/53466

* Could not run 'aten::coalesce' with arguments from the 'CUDA' backend. 'aten::coalesce' is only available for these backends: [SparseCPU, SparseCUDA, Autograd, Profiler, Tracer].
- seems that the tensor wasnt a sparse tensor
